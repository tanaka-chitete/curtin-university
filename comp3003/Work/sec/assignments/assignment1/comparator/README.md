# Comparator

Comparator is a Command-Line program written in Java which similarity-checks files using a modified LCS algorithm.

## Execution
To run Comparator, execute the following command from the `comparator` directory:

```
./gradlew run
```

Upon executing the above command, a GUI will appear on screen. Thereafter, to run a comparison click the `Compare...` button. You will be then prompted with a directory chooser to select which directory you would like to analyse the files of. Once doing so, click the `Open` button. The comparison will begin immediately.

If at any time you wish to abort a comparison, just click the `Stop` button or the window exit button.

## Clean Up

To clean up the `comparator` directory, execute the following command:
```
./gradlew clean
```
