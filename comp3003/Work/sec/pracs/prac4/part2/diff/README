This is the Gradle wrapper. Using this, you can create a Gradle-based project without actually 
installing Gradle. It should work on any machine with an internet connection.


Your next steps
---------------
(1) Running './gradlew init' (on Linux/MacOS) or 'gradlew init' (on Windows).
(2) Adding in the source files for the project you want to create.
(3) Create/edit build.gradle and settings.gradle as necessary.

Important: 'gradle/', 'gradlew' and 'gradle.bat' are at the top-level of your project directory, 
alongside 'src/', 'build/', 'build.gradle' and 'settings.gradle'. 


Purely for interest sake
------------------------
The Gradle wrapper files were generated by running 'gradle wrapper --gradle-version=5.6.2' on a
system with Gradle installed.
