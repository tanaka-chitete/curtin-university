gcd is able to compute the GCD of two integers for "reasonable" inputs without
any performance issues. The only reason the function may fail is due to the fact 
that each recursive call only reduces the number with which to divide x and y by 
only 1, which can lead to a StackOverflowError for large values of x and y.
