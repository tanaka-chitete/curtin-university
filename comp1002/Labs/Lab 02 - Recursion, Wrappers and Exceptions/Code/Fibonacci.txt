fib is able to compute the nth Fibonacci number for 0 <= n < 40 virtually
instantaneously and for n >= 40, performance begins to noticibly degrade, only
worsening for increasingly large values of n. The nature of fib being a tree
recursive function (without caching) results in an ever increasing repeated 
number of computations for increasingly large values of n, resulting in quickly
degrading runtimes.
